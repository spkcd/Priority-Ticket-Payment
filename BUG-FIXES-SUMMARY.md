# üêõ Bug Fixes Summary - Reply & Close Issues

This document summarizes the fixes implemented for two critical bugs in the Priority Ticket Payment plugin related to the "Reply & Close" functionality in Awesome Support.

## üéØ Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: "Reply & Close" Sets Status to "In Progress" Instead of "Closed"
**Problem**: When clicking "Reply & Close" in Awesome Support, the ticket status was incorrectly set to "In Progress" (ID: 2) instead of "Closed" (ID: 3).

**Root Cause**: The plugin wasn't properly using Awesome Support's native status update functions, causing the status to revert to the default "In Progress" state.

### Issue 2: Post SMTP Error - "Either of htmlContent or textContent is required"
**Problem**: Post SMTP plugin (when integrated with Sendinblue) was throwing errors because the email payload was missing one of the required content fields.

**Root Cause**: The email notification system wasn't ensuring both `htmlContent` and `textContent` fields were present and properly formatted for Post SMTP's API requirements.

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Enhanced Ticket Closing with Native Awesome Support Functions

#### New Function: `force_close_ticket_properly()`
```php
public static function force_close_ticket_properly($ticket_id, $reply_id = null) {
    // Method 1: Use wpas_update_ticket_status() if available
    if (function_exists('wpas_update_ticket_status')) {
        $result = wpas_update_ticket_status($ticket_id, 'closed');
        if ($result) return true;
    }
    
    // Method 2: Use wpas_close_ticket() as fallback
    if (function_exists('wpas_close_ticket')) {
        $result = wpas_close_ticket($ticket_id);
        if ($result) return true;
    }
    
    // Method 3: Manual close with proper taxonomy handling
    return self::manual_close_with_proper_status($ticket_id);
}
```

#### Enhanced Status Detection
- Dynamically finds the correct "closed" status term ID
- Handles multiple status naming conventions (closed, close, etc.)
- Updates both post status and taxonomy properly
- Triggers all necessary Awesome Support hooks

### Fix 2: Enhanced Email Content Validation for Post SMTP

#### Improved Content Validation
```php
// Ensure both content types are present and not empty for Post SMTP
if (empty($html_message) && empty($text_message)) {
    $fallback_content = 'Your ticket has been updated. Please log in to your account to view the response.';
    $html_message = $fallback_content;
    $text_message = $fallback_content;
} elseif (empty($html_message) && !empty($text_message)) {
    $html_message = nl2br(esc_html($text_message));
} elseif (!empty($html_message) && empty($text_message)) {
    $text_content = wp_strip_all_tags($html_message);
}
```

#### Enhanced Post SMTP Filter
```php
add_filter('postman_wp_mail_array', function($mail_array) use ($html_message, $text_message) {
    $mail_array['message'] = $html_message;
    $mail_array['htmlContent'] = $html_message;
    $mail_array['textContent'] = $text_message;
    $mail_array['content_type'] = 'text/html';
    $mail_array['charset'] = 'UTF-8';
    
    // Ensure alt_body for multipart emails
    if (!isset($mail_array['alt_body']) || empty($mail_array['alt_body'])) {
        $mail_array['alt_body'] = $text_message;
    }
    
    // Validate content lengths
    if (strlen($mail_array['htmlContent']) < 5) {
        $mail_array['htmlContent'] = 'Your ticket has been updated.';
    }
    if (strlen($mail_array['textContent']) < 5) {
        $mail_array['textContent'] = 'Your ticket has been updated.';
    }
    
    return $mail_array;
}, 5, 1);
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Recovery & Admin Notifications

### Email Failure Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Multiple sending methods with fallbacks
- **Ticket Preservation**: Tickets are always saved even if email fails
- **Admin Alerts**: Administrators are notified when email delivery fails

#### Admin Notification Function
```php
private static function notify_admin_of_email_failure($ticket_id, $reply_id, $customer_email, $error) {
    $admin_email = get_option('admin_email');
    $subject = 'Email Notification Failed - Ticket #' . $ticket_id;
    $message = sprintf(
        'An email notification failed to send for ticket #%d.
        
Customer Email: %s
Reply ID: %d
Error: %s

The ticket has been saved successfully, but the customer was not notified via email.
Please manually contact the customer if needed.',
        $ticket_id, $customer_email, $reply_id, $error
    );
    
    wp_mail($admin_email, $subject, $message, array('Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8'));
}
```

## üîÑ Updated Workflow

### Reply & Close Process Flow
1. **Detection**: `handle_before_reply_submit()` detects `wpas_do=reply_close`
2. **Flagging**: Sets temporary meta `_priority_ticket_pending_close`
3. **Processing**: `handle_after_reply_submit()` processes the close action
4. **Closing**: `force_close_ticket_properly()` uses native Awesome Support functions
5. **Validation**: Ensures proper status is set and persisted

### Email Notification Process Flow
1. **Content Preparation**: Ensures both HTML and text content exist
2. **Post SMTP Filter**: Applies enhanced filter with all required fields
3. **Primary Send**: Attempts wp_mail with full headers
4. **Fallback Methods**: 
   - Minimal headers
   - Plain text only
   - Alternative Post SMTP methods
5. **Error Handling**: Admin notification if all methods fail
6. **Recovery**: Ticket remains saved regardless of email status

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Reply & Close Testing
1. Create a priority ticket
2. Add a reply using "Reply & Close" button
3. Verify ticket status shows as "Closed" in backend
4. Confirm status persists after page refresh
5. Check logs for proper status update messages

### Email Notification Testing
1. Ensure Post SMTP is configured with Sendinblue (or other provider)
2. Add a reply to a priority ticket
3. Verify customer receives email notification
4. Check logs for successful email delivery
5. Test with intentionally broken email config to verify admin notifications

### Error Recovery Testing
1. Temporarily disable email functionality
2. Use "Reply & Close" on a ticket
3. Verify ticket still closes properly
4. Confirm admin receives failure notification
5. Re-enable email and verify normal operation resumes
