## [1.5.2] - 2024-12-19

### 🔧 **CRITICAL FIX: Enhanced Original Filename Preservation**

#### Advanced Filename Extraction System ✅ FIXED
- **Root Cause**: Original filenames from Elementor forms were not being reliably captured, resulting in files being saved with random generated names
- **Multi-Strategy Extraction**: Implemented 6 different strategies for extracting original filenames:
  - ✅ **ELEMENTOR FIELD DATA**: Enhanced detection from Elementor form field metadata
  - ✅ **$_FILES SUPERGLOBAL**: Direct capture from PHP upload data  
  - ✅ **HIDDEN FIELD CAPTURE**: JavaScript-stored original names in multiple hidden fields
  - ✅ **NORMALIZED FIELD DATA**: Enhanced field processing with original name extraction
  - ✅ **URL EXTRACTION**: Smart extraction from file URLs when available
  - ✅ **PATH EXTRACTION**: Fallback extraction from file paths with validation

#### Enhanced JavaScript Implementation ✅ IMPROVED
- **Multiple Hidden Fields**: JavaScript now creates multiple hidden fields with different naming patterns:
  - Primary field: `{field_name}_original_names`
  - Field ID pattern: `{field_id}_original_names`
  - Form pattern: `form-field-{field_id}_original_names`
  - Generic patterns: `attachment_original_names`, `file_original_names`
- **Universal Compatibility**: Ensures maximum compatibility with server-side extraction logic
- **Redundant Storage**: All hidden fields updated simultaneously for fail-safe operation

#### Comprehensive Debugging System ✅ ENHANCED
- **Detailed Logging**: Added extensive logging for troubleshooting filename issues:
  - Raw field data logging from Elementor
  - $_FILES and $_POST data inspection
  - Original filename extraction results from each strategy
  - File processing workflow tracking
  - Success/failure reporting for each file processed

#### Smart Fallback Logic ✅ BULLETPROOF
- **Pattern Recognition**: Skips obviously generated filenames (hex patterns, random strings)
- **Length Validation**: Ensures extracted filenames are meaningful (>3 characters)
- **Extension Validation**: Verifies filenames have proper file extensions
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to URL/path extraction when other methods fail

### 🎯 **Result**
Original filenames are now properly preserved:
- ✅ **"document.pdf"** stays as **"document.pdf"** (not "68504b2abf4f0.pdf")
- ✅ **"image123.jpg"** stays as **"image123.jpg"** (not "a7b8c9d0e1f2.jpg")
- ✅ **Multi-strategy extraction** ensures maximum filename preservation success rate
- ✅ **Enhanced debugging** allows troubleshooting of any remaining filename issues
- ✅ **Universal compatibility** works with various Elementor form configurations
