# Priority Ticket Payment - Custom Thank You Page Fix

## Problem Identified

The custom thank you page redirect functionality wasn't working due to several issues:

1. **Key Mismatch**: The default option key `custom_thank_you_url` didn't match what the payment handler was looking for (`custom_thank_you_page_url`)
2. **Hook Priority**: The redirect hook had low priority, allowing other plugins/themes to interfere
3. **Single Redirect Method**: Only used one hook which could be intercepted

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Option Key Mismatch
- Updated default option key from `custom_thank_you_url` to `custom_thank_you_page_url`
- Added migration code to move existing settings from old key to new key
- This ensures the payment handler can properly read the custom thank you URL setting

### 2. Improved Redirect Mechanism
- **Higher Priority Hook**: Changed `woocommerce_thankyou` hook priority from 10 to 1 for earlier execution
- **Template Redirect**: Added `template_redirect` hook as backup for better coverage
- **JavaScript Fallback**: Added JavaScript-based redirect as final fallback if PHP redirects fail
- **Loop Prevention**: Added transient-based tracking to prevent redirect loops

### 3. Enhanced Security and Debugging
- Used `wp_safe_redirect()` instead of `wp_redirect()` for better security
- Added comprehensive error logging for troubleshooting
- Added validation checks and proper error handling

## Files Modified

### `/priority-ticket-payment.php`
- Fixed default option key mismatch
- Added migration code for existing installations

### `/includes/class-payment-handler.php`
- Enhanced redirect mechanism with multiple hooks
- Added JavaScript fallback functionality
- Improved error logging and debugging
- Added loop prevention mechanism

## How to Test

1. **Check Settings**: 
   - Go to WooCommerce > Settings > Products > Priority Ticket Payment
   - Make sure "Enable WooCommerce Integration" is checked
   - Set your custom thank you page URL (e.g., `https://umgang-und-sorgerecht.com/thank-you-ticket/`)

2. **Debug Script** (Optional):
   - Upload `debug-thank-you-settings.php` to your WordPress root
   - Visit `https://yoursite.com/debug-thank-you-settings.php` as admin
   - Check all settings are configured correctly
   - **Delete the debug file after use!**

3. **Test Order**:
   - Create a test priority ticket order
   - Complete payment through WooCommerce
   - Should redirect to your custom thank you page instead of default WooCommerce page

## Expected Behavior

After the fix:
- Priority ticket orders will redirect to: `https://umgang-und-sorgerecht.com/thank-you-ticket/`
- Regular orders (non-priority tickets) will use default WooCommerce thank you page
- Order information will be passed as URL parameters for personalization

## Troubleshooting

### If redirects still don't work:

1. **Check Error Logs**: Look for "Priority Ticket Payment" messages in your error logs
2. **Plugin Conflicts**: Temporarily deactivate other plugins to test
3. **Theme Issues**: Try switching to a default theme temporarily
4. **Caching**: Clear any caching plugins/services

### Common Issues:

- **WooCommerce Integration Disabled**: Make sure it's enabled in settings
- **Invalid URL**: Ensure the custom thank you URL is valid and accessible
- **Plugin Conflicts**: Some payment or redirect plugins might interfere

## URL Parameters Passed

The redirect will include these parameters for personalization:
- `order_id`: WooCommerce order ID
- `order_key`: Order key for security
- `order_total`: Order total amount
- `currency`: Order currency
- `customer_name`: Customer billing name
- `customer_email`: Customer email
- `ticket_token`: Priority ticket token (if available)
- `submission_id`: Submission ID (if available)
- `ticket_tier`: Ticket tier (if available)

Example redirect URL:
```
https://umgang-und-sorgerecht.com/thank-you-ticket/?order_id=123&order_key=wc_order_abc123&order_total=50.00&currency=EUR&customer_name=John+Doe&customer_email=john@example.com
```

## Next Steps

1. Update your custom thank you page to handle the passed parameters
2. Test thoroughly with different order scenarios
3. Consider adding order details display using the passed parameters
4. Monitor error logs for any issues

The fix provides a robust, multi-layered approach to ensure custom thank you page redirects work reliably across different hosting environments and plugin combinations.
